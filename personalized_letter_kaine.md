Senator Kaine,

I am writing to you as a constituent of Virginia to express my concern over the impact that the rise of crypto assets such as "Bitcoin" are having on the environment, national security, and to investors.

As a concerned citizen I'm concerned about the lack of legislation to reign in the harm these products are having on our constituency and the country as a whole. I am a computer scientist who works in the public records space. I volunteered and worked on your Senate campaign in 2012. I have experimented with multiple crypt projects as an active participant writing code and contributing documentation. My experience is hands on as a contributor, not wholly as a speculative "investor". 

I am a contributor of money and time to many causes to help make Virginia a more equitable place to live. My hope in sharing my perspective is to provide technical experience to the hype surrounding crypto projects.

Cryptocurrencies in their current form provide no useful benefits to consumers and lacking regulation they have turned into predatory financial investments that disproportionately victimize the most financially vulnerable in our society. I recently gave a presentation about Web 3.0 to a diverse group of individuals. During the presentation, multiple people shared how they have been victims of cryptocurrency related scams. One woman shared that her husband had inadvertently given a hacker access to his crypto wallets as well as his personal checking and savings accounts. They were all drained and he was left with little recourse for restitution. 

Unlike an investment into a public company, bitcoin and other crypto assets have no mechanism of producing economic value, the only reason Bitcoin is worth anything is based on the collective belief that it will be worth more in the future. This is clearly an unsustainable belief, however people are being deceived by widespread misinformation campaigns into "investing" large sums of money into cryptocurrencies on the back of get rich quick promises. Those who are fortunate enough to make substantial returns from cryptocurrencies are doing so off the back of newer "investors" with the money they invest being used to pay off those who invested earlier. This form of investment vehicle only serves to siphon wealth from the public into the hands of insiders and is a form of fraud.

In addition to being a predatory investment scheme, cryptocurrency networks consume vast amounts of electricity tied to an enormous carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions. The consumption of these networks globally is equivalent to that of large European countries like Ireland and this networks provides no utility for this waste, other than to enrich a few insiders through financial scams.

From an information security standpoint, cryptocurrency is also used to facilitate the growing threat of ransomware which is an extortion scheme that foreign actors, those not-aligned with geopolitical interests of the United States, are using to undermine public and private infrastructure. I am deeply concerned about the impact these attacks will have on national security and our ability to protect public infrastructure and safeguard our country against attack.

The vast downsides of this technology vastly outweigh any potential upside. Honest discussions with neighbors, friends, and colleagues, in both my profession and our constituency, lead me to believe that these problems can only be solved with adequate regulation.

I believe that new laws and regulation are needed are needed rein in these financial products so that there is adequate investor protection, and that those that are predatory frauds or environmentally destructive can be legislated away through the democratic process.

Thank you for considering my concerns on this matter.
